# API documentation
https://revolutdev.github.io/business-api/

https://developer.revolut.com/docs/merchant-api/

# Supported API-s
* Business API 
* Merchant API

# Notes
For merchant API you only need a merchant API key

# Get NuGet Package
[RevolutAPI ](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RevolutAPI/)

# Source code client setup
1. Clone RevolutLib from [GitHub](https://github.com/ssrdio/RevolutAPI) inside your project directory
2. Add the RevolutApi project to yout solution
3. Add a reference to the RevolutApi project


# Business API Setup 
## Authorization and Authentication
1. generate certificate on machine with openssl (bellow snippet in ubuntu)
```bash
openssl genrsa -out privatekey.pem 1024
openssl req -new -x509 -key privatekey.pem -out publickey.cer -days 1825
openssl pkcs12 -inkey privatekey.pem -in publickey.cer -export -out revolut_pfx.pfx
base64 revolut_pfx.pfx
```
2. copy public cert into revolut
```bash
cat publickey.cer
```
3. because .NET core currnetly does not support *.pem certificats we created pfx in previous step now what we need to to is just to base64 encode certificate and we paste it into our configuration
```bash
base64 revolut_pfx.pfx
```

4. Include nuget package

# Revolut API client usage
## Auth
This part requres manual work where we need to provide new authorization code every 90 days. 

Call function `AuthorizationApiClient.Authorize` providing all the parameters
```c#
// issuer shuld be without http or https
Result<AuthorizationCodeResp> authorisationResp = await authorizationApiClient.Authorize("base64enconced pfx cert","certificate password","your domain (issuer)", "clientId provided by revolut", "authorization code provided by revolut");
// here you save rerresh token
db.Save(authorisationResp.Value.RefreshToken);
```
## Normal usage 
```c#
RevolutApiClient revolutApiClient = new RevolutApiClient(settings.Value.RevolutSettings.Endpoint, new RevolutAPI.Models.Authorization.RefreshAccessTokenModel
{
    PrivateCert = "base64enconced pfx cert",
    CertificatePassword = "certificate password",
    ClientId =  "clientId provided by revolut",
    Issuer = "your domain (issuer)",
    RefreshToken = db.getLastRefreshToken()
}, memoryCache);

CounterPartiesApiClient counterPartiesApiClient = new CounterPartiesApiClient(revolutApiClient);
Result<AddNonRevolutCounterpartyResp> resp = await _counterPartyApiClient.CreateNonRevolutCounterparty(req);
```

* `GetTransactions(DateTime from, DateTime to, string type, string counterparty = null)` - Retrieves historical transactions based on the provided query criteria.
* `GetTransactions(string from = null, string to = null, string counterparty = null, int count = 0, string type = null)` - Retrieves historical transactions based on the provided query criteria.

# Running API client tests
In order to run tests you need to modify the `Config.cs` file in the RevolutApiTests project.
This file contains global values used during test execution. The values are:
* `ENDPOINT` - The endpoint used during testing
* `TOKEN` - The authorization token

The following values are used when testing the payment endpoints. 
* `ACCOUNT_ID` - Sender account
* `COUNTERPARTY_ID` - Reciever counterparty
* `COUNTERPARTY_ACCOUNT_ID` - Reciever counterparty account
* `CURRENCY` - Currencry used in the trasaction tests

NOTE: These values should be prexisting accounts and couterparties with a non-empty balance. The currencty should also match, otherwise the tests will fail.
